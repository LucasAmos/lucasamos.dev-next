I recently gained the [AWS Solutions Architect Professional](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/) (SAP-C02) certification, here are my thoughts

### 1. Difficulty

I have passed a few other AWS certifications including the [AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-devops-engineer-professional/) (DOP-C02). The SAP-C02 certification was by far the hardest certfication exam that I have taken, the questions are long and nuanced and the breadth of the subject area is huge

### 2. Required study time

I estimate that I spent around 60 hours studying for this exam over the course of one month.
I scored 861/1000

### 3. My studying strategy

My strategy was simple; consume as much AWS knowledge as I could via courses, books, podcasts and practice exams. When I encountered an aspect of a service that I was not familiar with I would read the documentation and make notes on the key points which resulted in [40 pages of notes](https://github.com/LucasAmos/lucasamos.dev-next/tree/master/public/pdf/sap.pdf)

### 4. Resources that I used

By far the most important resource that I used to gain this certification was my job. At the time I was working on a primarily serverless event-driven content management platform which gave me a solid grounding in many of the topics that came up in the exam. That said I have zero experience with [Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/netapp-ontap/) and the exam contained two questions on this service!

Other resources that I used were

**Udemy courses**

1. [Stephane Maarek - Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-solutions-architect-professional/)
   I have used Stephane's courses when studying for all of my certfications, I only watched about 40% of this course as I found the audio to be mainly a reading of the slides. I would recommend this course even if only to read the slides

2. [Neal Davis - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional SAP-C02](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-training/)  
   I found the slides on this course to be of a much higher quality, with great diagrams and animations

3. [Stephane Maarek & Abhishek Singh - Practice Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional](https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/)  
   These practice questions were OK, I found the constant repetition of "As an AWS Solution Architect Professional" incredibly annoying, the questions are long enough as it is!

4. [Neal Davis - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional Practice Exam](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-aws-practice-exams/)  
   These practice questions were well written

5. [Jon Bonso - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional Practice Exam](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-solutions-architect-professional-practice-exams-sap-c02)  
   These practice questions were the best written and the closest to those in the exam

**Books**

[AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Professional Exam Guide](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-exam-guide-sap-c02-9781801813136)
by Patrick Sard & Yohan Wadia.  
This book is written by a Solutions Architect at AWS and contains a huge amount of interesting and useful information. It was a pleasure to read and great to give my eyes a rest from the computer screen. Be warned that the online practice questions, riddled with typos and ambiguities were the worst I have ever read so don't waste your time on them. Despite that this is an exceptional book

**Podcasts**

[AWS Developers Podcast](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/podcast/)  
Presented by an AWS Developer Advocate this contains lots of interesting interviews with people who create the AWS services featured in the exam

[AWS bites](https://awsbites.com/)  
At times listening to this podcast felt like I was listening to the documentation so I dropped it in favour of the AWS Developers Podcast

**Email newsletters**

[Yan Cui](https://theburningmonk.com/subscribe/)

- Yan Cui is the serverless boss, his emails only take 5 minutes to read and he excels at highlighting the trade-offs when using a particular AWS service

## My notes

All of this studying resulted in the creation of 40 pages of notes which can be
